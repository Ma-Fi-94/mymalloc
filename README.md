# mymalloc
Very much WIP right now! I'm following an online tutorial (https://danluu.com/malloc-tutorial/) for writing a simple memory manager in plain C. I'm slightly reformating the code, annotating it extensively, and might even be able to slightly improve upon in, but this remains to be seen ;).
